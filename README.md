# rome_unseal

Script adapted from this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ljCPvbr7VPEIlbZQvrUceLSDsdeo3oRH?usp=sharing), which uses [unseal](https://unseal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to implement the causal tracing part of [ROME](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05262).

The original notebook as well as unseal were built by [Tom Lieberum](https://github.com/tomFrederik/).
